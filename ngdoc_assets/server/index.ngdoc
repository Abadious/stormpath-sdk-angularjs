# Server Integration Guide

Front-end applications can not communicate with the Stormpath API directly,
and thus need an integrated back-end.  This page has information about
how to integrate Stormpath into your back-end.

## With Express.js

If you are using Express.js as your server, you can add our
[Stormpath Express Module][] to your server.



## With other environments

If you are using another type of server you will have to manually setup some
server endpoints to support this module.  Please visit
[Stormpath Docs](https://docs.stormpath.com) to find the language SDK of your
server environment.

Using the SDK of your choice, you need to implement the endpoints in the
following table.  The expected URLs can be changed by modifying the URLs
in the {@link api/stormpath.STORMPATH_CONFIG:STORMPATH_CONFIG STORMPATH_CONFIG}


**Endpoints to implement:**

## How Sessions Work

The Angular SDK is agnostic to the authentication strategy used, it assumes that
you are using a cookie-based system for authenticating the browser as a client.
However we do suggest that you use JWT access tokens.  You can read more in our
blog post, [Token Based Authentication for Single Page
Apps](https://stormpath.com/blog/token-auth-spa). Our [Stormpath Express Module]
does this for you.

Most of our SDKs have methods for issuing JWTs, and can be used to implement
this strategy in your server.

If you do not want to use JWT Access Tokens, you need to ensure the following on
your server:
* The {@link api/stormpath.STORMPATH_CONFIG:STORMPATH_CONFIG#properties_authentication_endpoint AUTHENTICATION_ENDPOINT} should set a cookie that identifies a session for the
user
* Your protected API endpoints should respond with `401 Unauthorized` if the
user does not have a valid session

## How Our Token Authentication Works

### Token Creation and Storage

When a user logs in, the server will issue an access token in the form of a
JWT.  This access token will be stored in an HTTP-only cookie and will also
set the Secure flag (so that it is only sent over HTTPS) in your production
environment.

A secondary refresh token will also be stored in a secure cookie, and this token
is used to get more access tokens as they expire.  The refresh tokens can
be revoked, using the Stormpath REST API.

You may have heard that cookies are insecure, but that is a vague statement.
The truth is that HTTP-only cookies, especially Secure-only cookies, are the
most secure place to store authentication information because the JavaScript
environment cannot access them.  This is the best way to protect yourself
from XSS attacks.

### Token Expiration and Revocation

Access tokens are valid until they expire.  You should set an expiration (TTL) that
makes sense for your application.  If you are using Stormpath to manage your access
tokens, you can modify the TTL by modifying the OAuth Policy of the Stormpath Application
that you are using for your Angular Application.
