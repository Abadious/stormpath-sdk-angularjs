Welcome to Stormpath's AngularJS Guide!
=================================================

This guide will walk you through the creation of an AngularJS application which is backed by a RESTful API and is secured with Oauth Access Tokens (JWTs).

We will show you how to:

* Secure your back-end API with a Stormpath SDK, using Oauth Access Tokens (JWTs)
* Provide a login form in your AngularJS application
* Fetch user data from your AngularJS application
* Use the token to know which UI routes are accessible by the user

When we explain how to protect your API routes we will be using Node.js
as the server examples.  If you are using Java please see our `Java Web App Plugin Guide`_
