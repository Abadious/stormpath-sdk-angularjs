.. _determine_login_state:

Is the user logged in?
========================================

The first thing we want to know:  is the user logged in or not?

If they are logged in we want to show them a menu bar which has
a link to their dashboard and a logout button.

If they are not logged in, we want to show them a login button

Using the $user service
